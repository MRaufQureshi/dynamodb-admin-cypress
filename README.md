ðŸ”” Hi there,

<img width="600" alt="XXX" src="https://www.monkeyuser.com/2022/unit-tests/248-unit-tests.png" class="center">

### Introduction

Test cases are written using Cypress Framework with Typescript for dynamodb-admin website which has test task defined in the test files.
This repo focuses only on the e2e aspect.

---

# Getting Started

To install the dependencies you're gonna need to authenticate your npm client.
In the command line, First navigate to folder '__tests__/test' and then install the package dependencies using the command `npm install` or `npm i`

# Testing Framework
Cypress

# Local Setup
UnZip this file locally

# Running E2E tests locally

Run the tests using the command `npm run test`. This brings the Cypress runner. You can now run the tests.

***Side note for understanding***

**Base.ts**

The Base.ts file contains the CSS selectors that build upon Page Object Model (POM). The selectors are categorized into distinct groups according to the pages they correspond to.

**Table.ts**

The Table.ts This class provides functions designed to aid assertions within the application.


# dynamodb-admin

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dynamodb-admin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamodb-admin)
> GUI for [DynamoDB Local](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/dynamodb-local-for-desktop-development/), [dynalite](https://github.com/mhart/dynalite), [localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) etc.

## Usage

### Use as globally installed app

```bash
npm install -g dynamodb-admin

# For Windows:
set DYNAMO_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000
dynamodb-admin

# For Mac/Linux:
DYNAMO_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000 dynamodb-admin
```

Options:
 - --open / -o - opens server URL in a default browser on start
 - --port PORT / -p PORT -  Port to run on (default: 8001)
 - --host HOST / -h HOST -  Host to run on (default: localhost)

You can specify host & port to run on by setting environment variables `HOST` and `PORT` respectively. This will override value specified on the command line. This is legacy way to specify the HOST & PORT.

If you use a local dynamodb that cares about credentials, you can configure them by using the following environment variables `AWS_REGION` `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

For example with the `amazon/dynamodb-local` docker image you can launch `dynamodb-admin` with:

```bash
AWS_REGION=eu-west-1 AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=local AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=local dynamodb-admin
```

If you are accessing your database from another piece of software, the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` used by that application must match the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` you used with `dynamodb-admin` if you want both to see the same data.

### Use as a library in your project

```js
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const {createServer} = require('dynamodb-admin');

const dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB();
const dynClient = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient({service: dynamodb});

const app = createServer(dynamodb, dynClient);

const host = 'localhost';
const port = 8001;
const server = app.listen(port, host);
server.on('listening', () => {
  const address = server.address();
  console.log(`  listening on http://${address.address}:${address.port}`);
});
```

## Development

Run `DYNAMO_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000 npm run dev` to start dynamodb-admin in development mode (with auto-reloading on change).
